# D3-Demo

This program is a D3 library demo, you can pick a stock to show (fed by the server) and then modulate the 
slider to change the datapoints shown. Additionally each datapoint counts mouseover events and then 
displays it onscreen at the next mouseover event.

To run this program you must follow the steps below.

    1. clone this repo locally and enter the directory.
    2. open a terminal at this directory and run the following command 'node server.js'
    3. open up a web browser and enter the following address 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/'
    4. Enjoy my little D3 demo as show below!
